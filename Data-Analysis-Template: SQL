This repository contains code snippets from my Data Science work in SQL

*Some basics to remember*
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

*Some of The Most Important SQL Commands*
SELECT - extracts data from a database : The data returned is stored in a result table, called result-set.
- Ex: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1; (selects only specified fields) or
      SELECT*FROM table1; (selects all the fields)
      SELECT DISTINCT column1,cplumn2 FROM table1; : return only distinct (different) values.
      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column1,column2) FROM table1; :lists the number of distinct values 
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index
